A Timeline of Taylor Swift’s Political Evolution
Jan. 31, 2020 – Swift explains taking a stand against Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn in Miss Americana Netflix documentary, releases political anthem “Only The Young”


During her highly anticipated Netflix documentary Miss Americana, Swift unpacked her decision to speak now on local as well as national politics. “I can’t see another commercial [with] her disguising these policies behind the words ‘Tennessee Christian values.’ I live in Tennessee. I am Christian. That’s not what we stand for,” the singer said in the feature-length film regarding her home state’s Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn ahead of the local senate race.

Swift called her out as a “flagrant enemy of feminism and gay rights” when she appeared on the Sundance Festival cover of Variety, considering Blackburn has voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and LGBTQ-friendly bills. Aside from her bad blood with Blackburn, Swift fought back tears in the doc when she acknowledged staying silent during the 2016 presidential election, arguing, “…but I can’t change that.… I need to be on the right side of history.”

Swift then rallied the younger generation of movers and shakers with her battle cry “Only The Young,” backed by a children’s choir and fueled by her frustration following the 2018 midterm elections. “I wrote it after the [2018] midterm elections, when there were so many young people who rallied for their candidate, whether it was a senator or congressman or congresswoman…. I was really upset about Tennessee going the way that it did, obviously. And so I just wanted to write a song about it,” she told Variety.
