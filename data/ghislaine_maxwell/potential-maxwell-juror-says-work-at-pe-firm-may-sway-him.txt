A private equity firm employee said he fears he can’t be impartial if he’s chosen to sit on a jury trying Ghislaine Maxwell on sex-trafficking charges because of his job.

“My main concern is that, given the number of high-profile individuals who are in PE and finance that have been implicated, given my proximity to these individuals, that’s my biggest fear,” the 25-year-old man from Manhattan, only known as Juror No. 87, told U.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan during jury selection Tuesday. The man didn’t say where he worked.
