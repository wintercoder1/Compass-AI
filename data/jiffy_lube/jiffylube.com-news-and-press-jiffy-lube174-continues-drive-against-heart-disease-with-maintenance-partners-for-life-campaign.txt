JIFFY LUBEÂ® CONTINUES DRIVE AGAINST HEART DISEASE WITH MAINTENANCE PARTNERS FOR LIFE CAMPAIGN

HOUSTON, February 29, 2008 - Today, Jiffy Lube announces that it's more than halfway to its goal of raising $1 million for the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women movement. Even though February and American Heart Month are almost in the rear-view mirror, Jiffy Lube wants to remind customers that it's not too late to join the fight against heart disease through the Jiffy Lube Maintenance Partners for Life campaign. The number one killer of women and men in the United States, heart disease accounts for 36 percent of all deaths annually. Customers can support the cause by visiting their local participating Jiffy Lube through the month of March.

"Since we introduced this campaign, I've heard from so many people who have a personal story about how heart disease has impacted their life," said Lisa Carlson, global director of marketing of Jiffy Lube International. "We're very proud of the commitment our employees and customers have shown for this campaign. I'm confident we're helping make a positive impact on the fight against heart disease."

Through the generous support of its customers, Jiffy Lube has already raised $572,130 and distributed 190,710 Maintenance Partners for Life books as of February 25, 2008. The company kicked off Maintenance Partners for Life on February 1, 2008, but customers can still make donations at the approximately 1,800 participating Jiffy Lube service centers through March 31, 2008. As a thank-you for making a $3 donation, customers will receive a Maintenance Partners for Life book, which offers $100 in savings on Jiffy Lube preventive maintenance services as well as heart-healthy recipes and lifestyle tips. One hundred percent of the funds raised by Jiffy Lube are donated to the Go Red For Women movement.

"Heart disease is a 365 day-a-year problem and one in three women has some form of cardiovascular disease," said Jennifer H. Mieres, M.D., Go Red For Women spokesperson and director of Nuclear Cardiology and associate professor of medicine at New York University. "There is a significant and ongoing need for more research and development so we can reduce the impact of heart disease. We are thrilled with the support we have received so far from Jiffy Lube and its customers, and look forward to continued success through this relationship."

The Jiffy Lube Maintenance Partners for Life campaign leverages the strong parallels between properly maintaining both heart health and vehicle health, and educates people on smart preventive maintenance of their bodies and vehicles.
